# WorkspacePort-RBX
Something I made for a seperate project, but I thought why not publish this since it could be useful to someone.

This is kinda like an emulator for the Roblox Workspace in a ViewportFrame. It uses the OOP method using metatables so you can treat it like an instance but also not really. Just look at the code and you'll know what's happening. :p
